# Tableau Challenge

NOTE: For this assignment, I had to upload each dashboard individually to my Tableau Public Profile (it wouldn't let me upload my entire workbook). Those three dashboards used up all the storage so I couldn't upload my Story - I attached it as a PDF in this repo instead. 

## Challenge Overview

For this challenge, I examined Citi Bike data from 2023 to determine common trends and patterns in Citi Bike utilization in New York. I focused on the differences between Member and Non-member Bikers, and I additionally created a dynamic map to display station popularity changes by month for city officials.

### Citi Bike Utilization: Peak Hours

First, I examined which hours were most popular and found two obvious spikes during morning and evening rush hours. When I broke it down into Member and Non-Member Bikers, I found that Member Bikers follow the rush hour trend while Non-Member Bikers tend to have much lower and stable utilization.

### Citi Bike Utilization: Popular Paths

Next, I examined which bike paths were most popular to get more insight on general travel patterns and flow between stations. I found two hubs of Citi Bike traffic in Battery Park / Tribeca area and in Hunters Point / Long Island City. When I broke it down into Member and Non-Member Bikers, the Non-Member Bikers top bike paths used were all concentrated in Central Park, while Member Bikers were much more spread out throughout New York.

### Dynamic Map

Finally, I created an interactive map that displays station popularity across the months in 2023. Darker shades indicate higher popularity, while lighter shades indicate less utilization.

### Tableau Story

I created a Tableau Story to recap all the visualizations and insights generated in this project.
